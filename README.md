# Hey there!
This is a simple scriot that allow for the downloading of youtube videos with either a full youtube video URL, or a youtube video shortlink. There's a couple of steps to do first. 
## Instructions:
First, open up `links.txt`, this is where you'll be putting the links of the videos you want to download. 
Paste the links into `links.txt` on the same line, seperated by ", ". 
Then, run the program. You'll be able to select whether you want to bulk download, or singularly download. 

Bulk download will download all of the videos in `links.txt` by itself. It will still show you the title, author, link, views, and length.

Singular download will download the videos one by one, with you being able to view all of the metadata provided by the author, such as description, post date, etc. You'll be able to select if you want to go to a seperate website to download, or if you want to directly download.
